This is a defunge interpretator made to interpret a certain type of code written as a 2d matrix called defunge code.

Befunge-93 supports the following instructions:

```
0-9 Push this number onto the stack.
+ Addition: Pop a and b, then push a+b.
- Subtraction: Pop a and b, then push b-a.
* Multiplication: Pop a and b, then push a*b.
/ Integer division: Pop a and b, then push b/a, rounded down. If a is zero, push zero.
% Modulo: Pop a and b, then push the b%a. If a is zero, push zero.
! Logical NOT: Pop a value. If the value is zero, push 1; otherwise, push zero.
` (backtick) Greater than: Pop a and b, then push 1 if b>a, otherwise push zero.
> Start moving right.
< Start moving left.
^ Start moving up.
v Start moving down.
? Start moving in a random cardinal direction.
_ Pop a value; move right if value = 0, left otherwise.
| Pop a value; move down if value = 0, up otherwise.
" Start string mode: push each character's ASCII value all the way up to the next ".
: Duplicate value on top of the stack. If there is nothing on top of the stack, push a 0.
\ Swap two values on top of the stack. If there is only one value, pretend there is an extra 0 on bottom of the stack.
$ Pop value from the stack and discard it.
. Pop value and output as an integer.
, Pop value and output the ASCII character represented by the integer code that is stored in the value.
# Trampoline: Skip next cell.
p A "put" call (a way to store a value for later use). Pop y, x and v, then change the character at the position (x,y) in the program to the character with ASCII value v.
g A "get" call (a way to retrieve data in storage). Pop y and x, then push ASCII value of the character at that position in the program.
@ End program.
  (i.e. a space) No-op. Does nothing.
```
The above list is slightly modified: you'll notice if you look at the Wikipedia page that we do not use the user input instructions and dividing by zero simply yields zero.

Example:
```
>987v>.v
v456<  :
>321 ^ _@
```

Output: 123456789
